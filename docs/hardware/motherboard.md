Motherboard
===========

The motherboard is the baord that brings all the components in a computer together to be able to operate. They come in a variety
of sizes (eg ATX, Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX). Motherboards are designed around a socket type (eg socket 1151 (Intel Skylake)) and 
will always have IO on them, and contain a standard-size faceplate to apply to the consumer's case.
