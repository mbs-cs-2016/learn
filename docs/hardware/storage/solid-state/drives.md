Solid State Drives
==================

A data storage device to store data in the same way as HDDs, allowing for backwards compatibility with
older hardware, allowing people to transition easier, but without using any mechanical parts making
them far more reliable than traditional HDDs.

## Advantages

- Faster read/write speeds than traditional HDDs (makes this a preferable storage choice to gamers, etc)
- Lower power consumption
- Not as delicate as traditional HDDs
- Not affected by magnets!
- It uses flash memory to store data, which makes them very reliable

## Disadvantages

- More expensive than traditional HDDs
- Storage capacity is not currently as high as HDDs
- Limited amount of writes (unless based on DRAM)
- Old data must first be deleted rather than overwritten
