Binary
======

Binary (or base-2) is a representation of numbers using only 2 symbols: ones and zeros.

| 2^7 | 2^6 | 2^5 | 2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |

Using the above table, you can represent any number in Binary. For example 201:

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| --- | -- | -- | -- | - | - | - | - |
| 1   | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

**128 + 64 + 8 + 1 = 201**
