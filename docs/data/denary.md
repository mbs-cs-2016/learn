Denary
======

Denary (or base-10) is a representation of numbers using only 10 symbols: zero, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight and nine.

| 10^2 | 10^1 | 10^0 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 100  | 10   | 1    |

Using the above table, you can represent any number in Denary. For example 201:

| 100 | 10 | 1 |
| --- | -- | - |
| 2   | 0  | 1 |

**(100 * 2) + (10 * 0) + (1 * 1) = 201**
