Instruction Cycle
=================

The Instruction Cycle (or Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle) is a process that the CPU goes through to process all instructions.
There are 3 stages to the Instruction Cycle: Fetch, Decode and Execute.

## Fetch

The Fetch stage first gets the memory address of the next instruction from the Program Counter, and then goes onto get the
data from memory.

## Decode

The Decode stage takes the data fetched by the Fetch stage and decodes it ready for the Execute stage.

## Execute

The Execute stage then goes onto execute the decoded instruction.
